Very simple weapon randomizer for Splatoon 1 since I couldn't find one.
Has a roulette feature inspired by Npesta's Extreme Demon Roulette

To launch, either extract and run the executable from the folder or alternatively if you have Python installed you have run the python code itself.

Pressing w or W on the menu will generate random weapons, from here you can either press y to generate another or n to take you back to the menu.

Pressing r or R on the menu will activate roulette mode. This will generate every weapon in the game, but only once, once a weapon is generated it is removed from the pool.
It is inspired by extreme demon roulette from geometry dash, so the goal is to get through as many weapons as you can. The maximum score is 91 since there is 91 weapons.
Pressing n will stop generating weapons and give you your final score, it will then send you back to the menu.

Pressing e on the menu will quit the program
